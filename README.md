### System Architecture


#### Hardware Localization Algorithm
Software component that, given raw positional and angle-of-arrival data from
our block network, will calculate the position of each block in a parsable format.


#### Binauralization API
Software component which produces a unified, binauralized audio track from multiple audio source block data streams, as received by the listener block.

_Input:_ positional data from hardware localization algorithm.

_Output:_



#### Block CAD and Prototype




#### Spatial Data Serialization




#### Hardware Bringup




#### Hardware Data Manager




#### Software Pipeline Plumbing




#### Robust User GUI




#### End-to-End Testing
